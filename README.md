## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I wanted to do this project because it seemed like a perfect one to test on Next.js. I have been wanting to get started with Next after becoming more confident with react. I had a blast using it and it mad creating the individual gallery pages so much easier.

### Continued development

I did not take the time to optomize the image sizes so things load slowly but I plan on fixing this soon as well as checking out how to implement the next/image tag. I tried it out but the images had some strange behaviour that I could not figure out. I also want to learn how to implement page transitions with Next js so look for an updated solution soon.

### Useful resources

- [NextJs Basics Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) - I learned more from the documentation tutorial than any intro to js video I watched on youtube. This tutorial is basic but it teaches you how to use static props and how to get started creating something
- [Next Js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - Documentation from Next is top notch.
